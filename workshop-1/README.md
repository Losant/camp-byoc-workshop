Wiring steps:

snap the arduino onto the breadboard at 14A - 30A

grab any jumper and put that one in GND and then a negative power rail next to it

grab another jumper and put one side in the arduino 1 input and the other side bends into C11

resistor one in negative power rail and the other into B10

grab your LED and put one end into D11 and the other into D10.
